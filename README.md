# README

### App Overview
OctoLink a messaging app that groups users through a set of minigames of their choice to give them that push to interact with new people. We value connectivity as our minigames are split by the three fundamentals of what we believe will most effectively build this atmosphere: ideation, cooperation, communication. There are 4 minigames (octogames) to choose from, all of which end with the computer recommend and introduce the user to a new friend based on their performance. The minigames also utilize functions such as dasha.ai and @platform to help interact with users and meet our goals.
